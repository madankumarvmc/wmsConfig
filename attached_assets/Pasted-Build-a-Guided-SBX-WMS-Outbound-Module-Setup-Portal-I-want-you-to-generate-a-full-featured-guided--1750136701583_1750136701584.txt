Build a Guided SBX WMS Outbound Module Setup Portal

I want you to generate a full-featured, guided setup portal for the SBX WMS Outbound Module.
The portal should use a step-by-step "wizard" interface, with each step corresponding to a logical phase of the Outbound Module setup.
The UI must be modern, responsive, and support both desktop and mobile use.

Here are the requirements and detailed field specifications:

1. Step 1: Define Task (Process) Sequences
Display a matrix/table where the user can create combinations of:

Storage Identifiers (SI):

Category (dropdown)

SKU Class Type (dropdown)

SKU Class (dropdown)

UOM (dropdown)

Bucket (dropdown)

Special Storage Indicator (checkbox)

Line Identifiers (LI):

Channel (dropdown)

Customer (searchable dropdown)

For each SI/LI combination, allow the user to:

Assign one or more task sequences (e.g., OUTBOUND_REPLEN, OUTBOUND_PICK, OUTBOUND_LOAD)

Set shipment acknowledgment triggers (dropdown: On Pick, On Load, etc.)

Allow Add/Edit/Delete of SI/LI combinations.

2. Step 2: Pick Strategy Definition
For each taskKind in the task sequence, allow the user to define one or more Pick Strategies:

TaskKind (auto-filled)

TaskSubKind (dropdown)

TaskAttrs (multi-select)

Strategy (dropdown: Cluster, Zone, Batch, etc.)

SortingStrategy (dropdown)

LoadingStrategy (dropdown)

GroupBy (multi-select: SKU, Order, Destination)

TaskLabel (text)

Show only relevant fields based on previous selections.

Allow multiple strategies per taskKind.

3. Step 3: HU Formation & Path Determination
For every Pick Strategy, allow the user to configure:

TripType (dropdown)

HU Kinds (multi-select: Pallet, Carton, Tote, etc.)

ScanSourceHUKind (dropdown)

PickSourceHUKind (dropdown)

CarrierHUKind (dropdown)

HU Mapping Mode (dropdown: Auto, Manual)

DropHUQuantThreshold (number)

DropUOM (dropdown)

AllowComplete (checkbox)

SwapHUThreshold (number)

DropInnerHU (checkbox)

AllowInnerHUBreak (checkbox)

DisplayDropUOM (checkbox)

AutoUOMConversion (checkbox)

MobileSorting (checkbox)

SortingParam (text or dropdown)

HUWeightThreshold (number)

QCMismatchMonthThreshold (number)

QuantSlottingForHUsInDrop (checkbox)

AllowPickingMultiBatchfromHU (checkbox)

DisplayEditPickQuantity (checkbox)

PickBundles (checkbox)

EnableEditQtyInPickOp (checkbox)

DropSlottingMode (dropdown)

EnableManualDestBinSelection (checkbox)

Provide real-time validation and show a visual flowchart of HU movement paths (optional).

4. Step 4: Work Order Management Strategy
For every Pick Strategy, allow the user to configure:

MapSegregationGroupsToBins (checkbox)

DropHUInBin (checkbox)

ScanDestHUInDrop (checkbox)

AllowHUBreakInDrop (checkbox)

StrictBatchAdherence (checkbox)

AllowWorkOrderSplit (checkbox)

UndoOp (checkbox)

DisableWorkOrder (checkbox)

AllowUnpick (checkbox)

SupportPalletScan (checkbox)

LoadingUnits (number)

PickMandatoryScan (checkbox)

DropMandatoryScan (checkbox)

Provide contextual help and warnings for conflicting options.

5. Step 5: Stock & Bin Allocation Strategy
For each relevant SI, allow the user to define allocation strategies for PICK and PUT modes:

Mode (dropdown: PICK, PUT)

Priority (number)

SkipZoneFace (checkbox)

OrderByQuantUpdatedAt (checkbox)

SearchScope (dropdown: Zone, Area, Warehouse)

StatePreferenceOrder (multi-select)

PreferFixed (checkbox)

PreferNonFixed (checkbox)

StatePreferenceSeq (number)

BatchPreferenceMode (dropdown: FIFO, FEFO, LIFO, etc.)

AreaTypes (multi-select)

Areas (multi-select)

OrderByPickingPosition (checkbox)

UseInventorySnapshotForPickSlotting (checkbox)

OptimizationMode (dropdown: Speed, Capacity, Custom)

Allow Add/Edit/Delete for allocation strategies.

Show real-time conflict detection.

6. Step 6: Review & Confirm
Show a summary of all configurations from previous steps.

Allow users to expand/collapse sections and edit any step.

Highlight validation errors or warnings.

Provide Confirm & Save action.

Additional Features
Contextual help (tooltips, inline help, and video guides for complex fields)

Role-based access (only authorized users can configure or approve setup)

Audit trail (log all changes for compliance and rollback)

Mobile support (responsive design, offline support for warehouse floor use)

Integration hooks (API endpoints for ERP, TMS, e-commerce, and device integration)

User Journey Example:

Start Setup Wizard

Define SI/LI Task Sequences

Configure Pick Strategies (for each sequence)

Set HU Formation & Path (for each strategy)

Define Work Order Management (for each strategy)

Configure Stock/Bin Allocation (for each SI)

Review & Confirm

Setup Complete

Instructions:

Use React (preferred), TypeScript, and Material UI (or similar modern component library).

Each step should be a separate component/page.

Use state management (e.g., React Context or Redux) to persist data between steps.

Ensure field validation, user-friendly navigation, and accessibility.

Include mock data and stubs for dropdowns and search fields.

Provide clear code comments and modular structure.

Goal:
Generate a production-ready, maintainable codebase for a guided SBX WMS Outbound Module setup portal, fully matching the above requirements and field details.
